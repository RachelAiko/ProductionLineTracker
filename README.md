# ProductionLineTracker
Project for COP 3003 - Object Oriented Programming
## Project Details
Object Oriented Production Line Tracker with a GUI and database. This is my Object Oriented Programming class project. For COP 3003 at Florida Gulf Coast University for fall semester 2020.
It is a Java FX application that simulated a production line management system and uses Gradle to handle dependencies.
